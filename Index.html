<h1>Why everyone should learn to type fast.</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px"> You may ask, why would it be important to type fast? Well..... It is very important as you type everyday, often for many hours a day. So why wouldn't you want to type fast to be more productive? It requires some practice each day but is not very hard! You don't need a fancy keyboard or a gaming pc to type fast! You can do it with what you have. On this basic website, I will list reasons, websites, and tips and advice for learning to type fast.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Stop wasting your time typing slowly!</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Typing slowly is waste of time, every word you type slow is more of your time wasted. By typing fast you can decrease the amount of time you have to spend typing whilst having the same amount of quality(assuming you don't make mistakes). Once you learn how to type fast and touch type you will have fun trying to beat your highscore on websites like MonkeyType.<p></p> <a href="https://monkeytype.com/" target="_blank" URL>MonkeyType</a>

<h2>Step 2. How to learn to type fast!</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Learning to type fast can be fun,exciting, and <em>Addicting</em> There are many helpful sites like my personal favorite <em>Monkeytype</em> (link above). I like this website due to the minimalistic design and no ads, it is very easy to concentrate on Monkeytype. There are many other sites out there but few have the same effect as Monkeytype has, often covered in distracting ads and noises which <em>Surely</em> don't help you type faster, right? In my opinion, you need to practice typing everyday, it doesn't have to be for long but the practice should help you gain speed fairly quickly. Another <em>VERY</em> important part is knowing how to type properly, what I mean by this is not just looking at your keyboard and smashing down the keys. You need to learn to type without looking down, this will increase your speed <b>Dramatically</b>. That's all I have to say..... Just keep <em>typing!</em></p>

<h2>Step 3. Equipment</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px"> When learning to touch type or to type fast, equipment is not really important, sure it's nice to have that fancy Two hundred dollar gaming keyboard but in reality you'll be fine with what you have so long as it works. Another thing you will need is an internet connection.) </p>
